        <p> I'm a student at CMU studying AI and human-computer interaction. I've spent the last two summers interning at Google. 
            Though I was born in Hyderabad, India, I grew up in the humid outskirts of the Houston area (more specifically - Sugar Land, TX). 
            Outside of school, I really enjoy reading, taking long walks, and embarking on culinary adventures with my mom. 
            I also greatly enjoy playing games with family and friends - my current favorite being Secret Hitler.
